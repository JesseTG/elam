/** \brief This class holds the character classes used by an Engine.

\see Engine::characterClasses()

There are three major classes of chracters:
 - names
  - names can be variables, constants, functions
  - the names class has two sub-classes
   - start-of-names is characters that may start a name, usually letters and underscores
   - all-of-names is characters that may be contained anywhere in names, this class must include the complete start of names class
 - operators
  - any sequence of these characters is interpreted as unary or binary operator
 - whitespace
  - whitespace can separate other tokens, but is ignored itself

None of these three classes may overlap. There are several more minor classes:
 - literals
  - the character class actually only contains characters that can start a literal, the continuation and end of literals is determines by a callback routine
  - characters in this class may overlap with names, but must not overlap with operators, whitespace and start-of-names
 - parentheses
  - are two distinct characters that group expressions, none of them must be contained in any other class
 - comma
  - a single character separating arguments in functions, the comma character must not be contained in any other class
 - assignment
  - one or two characters that denote an assignment
  - both are optional, both must be contained in operators
  - one of the characters, if it exists, is the first character of an assignment
  - the other of the characters, if it exists, is the last character of an assignment
  - just those two characters are the simple assignment operator
  - both surrounding another operator combine the operation with assignment (e.g. a+=b is equivalent to a=a+b)

		/** sets the characters used for assignment operators
		\param start if not '\0' the character that marks the start of an assignment
		\param end if not '\0' the character that marks the end of an assignment
		
		The combination of both characters along (without whitespace) is the direct assignment operator. In automatic assignment operator mode any operator that starts with the start character and ends with end character is regarded as an implicit assignment.
		
		In the default configuration the start character is not set ('\0') and the end character is '=', so "a=1" will assign the value "1" to the variable "a" and "a += 1" is equivalent to "a = a + 1".
		
		You can turn this automatism around by defining a start character only (e.g. start='=' and end='\0'). Then the assignment would still be "a = 1", but the combination of assignment and "+" would become "a =+ 1".
		
		If you define both characters then both must be present in assignments. For example with start=':' and end='=' then assignment becomes "a:=1" and assignment with "+" becomes "a :+= 1".
		
		If set, both characters must be part of the operator class.
		
		If both start and end are '\0' it will be impossible to make assignments*/

		 - Invalid is returned if the character does not match any class, parsing should stop here
		 - If Literal is returned the calling engine must use specialized literal checking functions to find the end of the literal, the next character checke with this routine should be the first one behind the end of the literal
		 - Assignment characters are returned as Operator class
		 - Whitespace class characters should be ignored
		 - Special character types (Par*, Comma) must be tokenized separately
		 - Any other type (Name, Operator) must be concatenated until the return type changes
