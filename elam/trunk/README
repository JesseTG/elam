ELAM = Elementary Logic and Arithmetic Machine

see COPYING for details

Hint: I really mean GPL, not LGPL. You can't use this library in proprietary code!

This engine can be fed simple arithmetic formulas and will calculate their
result, similar to those used in languages like C or Pascal. It is not able
to solve algebraic systems or use fancy expressions.

ELAM is based on and made for Qt 4.x.

See the documentation for details. Just point your browser at doc/index.html.
